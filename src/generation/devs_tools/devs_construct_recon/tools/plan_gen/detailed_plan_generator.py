If an older error required Source to retain stdin and the current error says
Writer lacks stdout, add stdout to Writer while leaving Source's stdin entry
unchanged. A repair is monotonic across independent constraints.

Wrong: add `{{"name":"stdout", ...}}` to a child's `output_ports`.
Right: leave its DEVS ports unchanged and add

atomic child that observes that event.
