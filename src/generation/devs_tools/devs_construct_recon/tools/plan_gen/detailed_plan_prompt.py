COUPLED_INSTRUCTION = """
<TaskInstruction>
Generate a detailed specification for the ROOT COUPLED module and canonical
interface specifications for its direct children.

[STEP 1: Design Coupled Wrapper (detailed_plan)]
- `function` summarizes what the complete subtree achieves. The coupled class
  itself contains components and couplings, not active state-transition logic.
- The coupled class does not call stdin, stdout, stderr, files, or services.
  Record each such operation on a direct child subtree; a leaf atomic model in
  that subtree will perform it.

[STEP 2: Design Children (children_plans)]
For each direct child, execute this workflow:
1. Copy `model_type` based on the global plan.
2. Briefly describe responsibility in `function`. Replace a coarse phrase such
   as "emits an event" with the concrete mechanism: sends a DEVS message to a
   named consumer, writes a record to an OS stream, or explicitly does both.
3. List the child's init args and preserve configuration needed below it,
   including runtime multiplicity.
4. Define ports needed to connect this child to a sibling or to the current
   coupled boundary. Give matching ports compatible payload types and protocols.
   If one child must wait for a sibling to become available or complete work,
   give the waiting child a feedback input and include the return route.
5. For an atomic child, `external_io` lists only OS operations that child
   directly performs. For a coupled child, it lists operations that must be
   delegated further inside that subtree.
6. If the requirements declare a consumable stdin stream, exactly one child
   subtree receives it and other children receive parsed data through DEVS
   ports. If the requirements say that no stdin is required, no child receives
   stdin; command-line configuration travels through constructor arguments.
7. For ordinary event JSONL, the atomic model that changes state writes that
   state record, and the atomic model that sends a DEVS message writes that
   message record. Emit each required record once. Do not introduce or use a
   central writer unless the requirements explicitly need cross-model
   aggregation, global ordering beyond simulation-time order, or one final
   combined report. Before returning, compare every explicitly required record
   type with the children's `external_io`; each must be covered where it is
   produced, even if the coarse global-plan description omitted stdout. Treat
   the stated record schemas as literal contracts: preserve every required
   envelope and payload field rather than shortening a repeated schema.
8. Populate each child's `related_requirement_ids` while its concrete
   constructor, ports, behavior, and external IO are in view. Include every
   ledger item relevant to planning or implementing that child subtree,
   including shared workflow, schema, timing, and parameter items. The same ID
   may appear on multiple cooperating children. Complete or correct the coarse
   global-plan associations rather than merely copying them.

Use the shared `<FieldContract>` below for the exact content required in each field.

[STEP 3: Design couplings]
- Finalize every child's input and output ports before writing this list. Then
  build each route by copying its endpoint names from those final port lists;
  do not invent, rename, or reverse a port while writing `coupling_rules`.
- Before connecting edges, distinguish the semantic roles of events received by
  each child. Different events such as a new arrival and completion feedback
  need separate input ports unless the port protocol explicitly defines a
  tagged union that distinguishes them.
- Return `coupling_rules` as a list with one complete routing rule per item.
  Ordinary language is allowed. A rule may describe one fixed connection or an
  indexed, repeated, conditional, one-to-many, or many-to-one family.
- List actual routes only; use an empty list when no coupling is needed rather
  than adding architectural commentary or notes about absent EIC, IC, or EOC
  routes.
- Use `parent.<input_port>` for an EIC from the current DEVS boundary and
  `parent.<output_port>` for an EOC to that boundary.
- `parent` exposes only the DEVS ports declared for the current coupled model.
  OS targets such as stdin, stdout, and files are `external_io`, not ports, and
  must never appear as coupling endpoints.
- Name the relevant model instances or families and ports clearly enough for
  code generation. Include required startup and busy/ready feedback routes.
  Configuration travels through constructor arguments, not invented ports.
- In a fixed route, a child source is one of that child's output ports and a
  child target is one of that child's input ports. Read the declared interfaces;
  do not infer direction from a port's name.
- Before returning, compare every fixed endpoint with the interfaces in this
  same response. Do not invent a self-route for logging; a planned aggregation
  sink is a target unless the requirements explicitly give it an outgoing DEVS
  message.
- A group rule must name its member set or family and a port declared by every
  member. Do not say "all modules" when that would include a sink or a child
  without the named output.
</TaskInstruction>
"""


RESPONSIBILITY_GUIDANCE = """
<PlanningRule>
The global plan gives starting roles, not complete behavior. Keep a sole stdin reader,
but add duties or ports needed for the workflow. One leaf atomic model directly
reads each external input stream; other models receive data through DEVS ports. If future arrivals
and a business model's timer would compete for one next internal event, use a
separate source atomic. Do not invent user-visible behavior.
</PlanningRule>
"""


COUPLING_EXAMPLE = """
<CouplingVariants>
The same rule list can describe a current DEVS boundary or a runtime-sized
family. Every endpoint below is a declared DEVS port; stdin, stdout, and files
would instead appear in a leaf atomic model's `external_io`:
[
  "Forward parent.request_in to Dispatcher.request_in.",
  "For every Worker instance created from worker_count, connect Dispatcher.job to Worker.job.",
  "Connect Server.available to Dispatcher.server_available so queued work is released only when the server is ready.",
  "Forward every Worker.result_out to parent.result_out."
]
Read each arrow literally: for `A.x -> B.y`, `x` is an output port of A and
`y` is an input port of B. An atomic model's internal state changes belong in
its transition logic and need no self-coupling.

A named output record is not automatically a DEVS message. For example, if a
Server writes a `job_completed` record when its own timed service finishes and
no other model is required to receive that event, do not invent a
`Server.job_completed -> Server.job_completed` route. If another model must use
the completion to release work, declare that consumer input and route to it.
Likewise, a rejected request that is logged and then leaves the system has no
route back to the input source unless the requirements name a recovery action.

For a real return message, put the port on the side that uses it. If Worker
finishes work and Queue consumes that fact, declare `completed_out` in Worker's
`output_ports`, declare `completion_in` in Queue's `input_ports`, and write
`Worker.completed_out -> Queue.completion_in`. Do not put `completion_in` in
Queue's `output_ports` merely because Queue owns the corresponding state.

At a nested boundary, a parent connects only to its direct child. For example,
the root rule `Gateway.packet_out -> Server.packet_in` uses a port declared on
the coupled Server; Server's own detail plan can then route
`parent.packet_in -> Receiver.packet_in`. The root must not address
`Server.Receiver.packet_in` directly.

One output coupled to several inputs broadcasts every message. If a Dispatcher
must select exactly one of Worker1 and Worker2, give it separate `to_worker_1`
and `to_worker_2` outputs, or state a tagged-message filter explicitly in each
receiver's input protocol; two plain couplings do not perform selection.
For a runtime-sized family, include a stable per-instance identifier such as
`worker_id` in the child blueprint constructor whenever routing, payloads, or
logs use that identifier. If a tagged assignment is broadcast to the family,
state explicitly that each worker ignores assignments for other IDs.

When an expiring Queue must retain work but a separate Coordinator owns resource
selection, use an explicit handshake instead of transferring the work early.
One valid pattern is: `Queue.work_available -> Coordinator.work_available` is
only a notice; `Coordinator.claim(resource_id) -> Queue.claim_in` offers a
selected resource; `Queue.claimed_work(work, resource_id) ->
Coordinator.claimed_work` atomically removes the current non-expired work; then
the Coordinator emits and records the assignment. A notice alone does not stop
the Queue's expiration timer.
</CouplingVariants>
"""


ROOT_COUPLED_EXAMPLE = r"""
<StageExample>
This is a complete ROOT COUPLED response for exclusive dispatch with no stdin.
It demonstrates three distinct boundaries: a port-only message has an internal
consumer, an external-only record has no invented port, and one semantic event
may require both a DEVS port emission and a separate stdout record. The internal
assignment payload preserves `arrival_time` even though the smaller public log
schema does not expose it. CLI configuration is propagated by constructors;
stdout never appears in `coupling_rules`.
The empty requirement-ID lists are specific to this example, which has no live
ledger. In a real response, use the relevant IDs shown in the current prompt.

allocator, the allocator offers a selected resource ID to the queue, the queue
returns one claimed item with that ID, and only then does the allocator emit an

through DEVS ports; they do not print JSONL. One collector retains those facts

Keep the business request and its public input-event record on separate ports

- `implementation_example`: select exactly one tested complete-file example
  from `<AtomicImplementationExampleCatalog>`. Match the example's complete

- `interface_change_requests`: normally empty. If the required behavior is

INHERITED_COUPLED_INSTRUCTION = """
<TaskInstruction>
The current coupled module's constructor and boundary ports in
`<LockedInheritedContract>` are immutable. Expand only its missing subsystem
details and design canonical interfaces for its direct children.

[Generate these fields]
- `function`: the capability achieved by the subtree. The coupled wrapper itself
  remains a pure structural container.
- `children_plans`: one canonical simple plan for every direct child named in the
  global plan. These constructors and ports become each child's locked interface
  when that child is expanded later.
- `coupling_rules`: one complete natural-language routing rule per item, using
  the locked current boundary and the newly generated child interfaces.
- `interface_change_requests`: normally empty. Use it only if the locked current
  boundary makes the required decomposition impossible. Do not rewrite that
  boundary in this response.

The `external_io` in the locked simple plan lists OS operations delegated into
this subtree. Pass each operation to one child subtree at this level until a
leaf atomic model directly performs it. The coupled class itself performs none.

[Child interface design]
- Return exactly one `children_plans` entry for every direct child named in
  TargetContext, with its model type taken from GlobalPlanOverview.
- Define each child's constructor and all ports needed to connect to a current
  boundary port or communicate with a sibling. Preserve configuration needed by
  deeper descendants and any required runtime multiplicity.
- Make corresponding port protocols consistent. Assign each delegated external
  IO stream to exactly one child subtree; do not copy it to several siblings.
- If one final aggregate record is explicitly required, select one leaf atomic
  model to write it and route the needed data to that subtree through DEVS ports.
- Populate each child's `related_requirement_ids` from the current subtree's
  ledger slice. Include all items relevant to that child's concrete interface,
  behavior, external IO, shared schemas, timing, and parameters. IDs may be
  shared by cooperating siblings; refine rather than blindly copy the coarse
  global-plan associations.

[Coupling design]
- Finalize the direct children's input and output ports before writing this
  list. Then build each route by copying endpoint names from the locked current
  boundary and those final child port lists; do not invent, rename, or reverse
  a port while writing `coupling_rules`.
- Write one complete routing rule per list item. Fixed and runtime-sized,
  indexed, conditional, one-to-many, and many-to-one rules are all allowed.
- List actual routes only; use an empty list instead of architectural commentary
  or notes about routes that do not exist.
- Use `parent` only for the current boundary; otherwise name the relevant direct
  child instance or family and ports clearly. Configuration travels through
  constructor arguments, not ports invented solely for configuration.
- `parent` means the current model's declared DEVS boundary ports, never an OS
  target such as stdin, stdout, or a file; a leaf atomic model performs those
  operations directly.
- For a fixed route, read source and target direction from the locked/current
  interfaces rather than inferring it from port names.
- Check every fixed endpoint against the interfaces in this response. Do not
  invent a self-route for logging; an external-IO sink is a target unless the
  requirements explicitly give it an outgoing route.
- A group rule must name its member set or family and a port declared by every
  member; do not use "all modules" if the set includes a sink or a child without
  that output.
- Include routes required by genuine startup messages and busy/ready feedback.
  Every feedback loop needs a waiting or termination condition.

Use the shared FieldContract below for every child field. Do NOT output a second
copy of the current module's model_init_args, input_ports, output_ports, or
external_io.
</TaskInstruction>
"""

FIELD_GUIDANCE = """
<FieldContract>
[model_init_args]
- `name` and `parent` are framework-reserved. Include each exactly once as the first two args. Use `name.type="str"`. Use `parent.type="object"` and describe it as the framework parent reference or None. The primitive-type restriction below applies to business arguments and port payloads, not the framework parent reference.
- For each additional arg, state its source: parent init arg, explicit scenario constant, or local derivation. Preserve values through intermediate coupled models when deeper descendants need them. Never replace a missing propagated value with a placeholder such as `0`, `None`, or an unrelated default.

[input_ports / output_ports]
- Ports carry messages between DEVS models. Do not create a `parent` boundary
  port solely to print or save a record. If the requirements explicitly call
  for a separate aggregation model, route records to it through DEVS ports and
  list the actual stdout/file call only in that leaf model's `external_io`.
- Allowed port and init-arg types: int, float, bool, str, dict, list.
- For dict/list values, use a strict Python representation:
    - BAD (Vague Summary): "Information about the sent packet including sequence number and retry flag."
    - BAD (Vague List): "A list of jobs."
    - GOOD (Strict Dict): "Packet info. Format: {'sequence_number': int, 'control_bit': str, 'is_retry': bool}."
    - GOOD (Strict List): "List of jobs. Format: [{'job_id': int, 'priority': float}]."
    - GOOD (Nested): "Format: {'metadata': {'timestamp': float, 'source': str}, 'payload': list[int]}."
- Every port protocol contains `initial_signal` and `description`.
- Keep `initial_signal` conservative. Describe only the startup interaction on this port:
    - For an input port: whether the model expects to receive a startup message.
    - For an output port: whether the model actively sends a startup message.
    - Use `None` when no startup interaction is required.
- Do not predefine startup payload content, invent placeholder/default messages, or create startup messages merely to initialize a port or satisfy a protocol field. Put payload schema in `structure` and runtime protocol details in `description`.
- If startup needs a handshake, choose exactly one sender. If a sender must wait for downstream availability, define explicit feedback such as `ready`, `available`, `ack`, or completion.

[external_io]
- Use `external_io` for OS/environment interactions: stdin, stdout, stderr, files, external services, printed records, and final reports. Use DEVS output ports when another DEVS model needs the data to continue simulation.
- `target` must be exactly one of `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `file`, or `other`. Put path, direction, mode, and format details in `content`, not in `target`.
- `content` must state direction, exact schema or format, source or derivation logic, timing, multiplicity, and any resource/path details.
- Treat concrete values in a user-provided example record as illustrations
  unless the requirements explicitly declare them fixed constants. Preserve
  field names and types while stating how runtime values are derived.
- Do not claim that one child writes records produced only by a sibling unless
  those records are explicitly routed to it through DEVS ports.
- In the current model's detailed_plan, list only OS operations performed by
  that model. In children_plans, an atomic child lists operations it performs;
  a coupled child lists operations that must be passed farther down its subtree.
- For ordinary event output, the model that changes state writes its state
  record and the model that sends a DEVS message writes that message record.
  Emit each required record once. A separate writer is appropriate only when
  the requirements explicitly demand aggregation or a combined final record.

- If a valid input range includes arithmetic edge cases such as a zero denominator, empty collection, zero duration, or missing optional record, define the exact behavior instead of leaving it implicit.
- State one simulation clock unit for each subsystem. If an external record uses a different unit, describe the exact conversion once. Do not apply a second conversion when the DEVS clock already uses the target unit.

[implementation_example]
- This field appears only in an atomic detailed plan. Select exactly one entry
  from AtomicImplementationExampleCatalog by comparing the full behavior:
  startup, timing, input consumption, buffering/state, output, and external IO.
- The selected file is an implementation pattern, not an extra requirement.
  Adapt its class, interface, payloads, and equations to the locked contract.

[related_requirement_ids]
- This field appears only on child simple plans. List valid IDs from
  RelevantRequirementsForCurrentSubtree that the child needs for its planning
  or implementation. It records relevance; it does not assign an OS operation.
